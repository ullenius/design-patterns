# Copy Constructor
Alternative approach for the Prototype pattern.<br>
Create a Overloaded Constructor which takes a reference of the same Object,
and sets its members.

## Copy Method
Alternative approach from Copy-Constructor when a hierarchy is applied.
Instead create a inheritable copy-method that returns the right reference with 'this' keyword.
Solution to get rid of dangerous casting inside the constructor when coding to supertype.
