# Model - View - Controller (MVC)
More of a architectural pattern and a 
follower of the principle 'Separation of Concerns'
Pattern that organizes code into 3 parts. 

* Model - Contains the data(POJO's)'The database objects'.
* View - The presenter of data to the Client.
* Controller - The business logic, lays between the Model and View.

The client use the Controller
to manipulate the Model to update the View.
