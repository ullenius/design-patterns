# Programming to an Interface
or 'Program to an Supertype'<br>
A principle about for better encapsulation and makes your code more flexible and dynamic during runtime.<br>
The code will be more adaptive for change. Since its referencing the Supertype and not the implementation class.<br>
In Java a Interface or a Abstract Class can be used to achieve abstraction.

##### Interface vs Abstract Class
A abstract class contains a state while a interface contains a implementation.
