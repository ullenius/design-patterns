# Composition over Inheritance
The object relationship Composition(HAS-A) over Inheritance(IS-A).
Its easier to create a Object that has-a different dependencies than to find is-a dependencies for a Object. <br>
Computer made Object relationships tend to be better to think that a Object
HAS-A instead of IS-A. <br>
The Object can be more focused and encapsulated.<br>
The principle wants to avoid big class hierarchies

* Composition - The Object cannot be created without the Composition Object
* Aggregation - The Object can be created without its Aggregation Object.
